# Hello-World
RefugeeWomenCode.
Me,I once aspired to become a frontend developer, aiming to learn coding as much as i can and use the knowledege and skills to train refugee women how to code. Then I rediscovered who I really was!
I am a people's person by nature. I take pride in making people and places better than I found them.

I have worked in the areas of people development, employer branding and recruitment in both the
private and public sector. This experience has enabled me to develop skills and expertise that are strongly people-oriented, yet focused on business growth. Talent acquisition and retention can be hard, however when a perfect match is made, both the individual and organization thrive. Making every TA practitioner's dream come true.
