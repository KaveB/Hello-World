# Hello-World
RefugeeWomenCode
I am an aspiring frontend developer, aiming to learn as much as i can and use the knowledege and skills to train refugee women how to code. I am the founder of an organization called womenacrossborders and our aim is to empower refugee women to be self sustainable. I believe equiping refugee women with skills for the future, will enable them to be strong contributors to societies they end up calling home.
